## Introduction

This repository provides an implementation for training a causal language model using a plethora of technologies including PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, and the PEFT library. The codebase is designed to be modular, scalable, and easy to understand.

## Requirements

    Python 3.9 or higher
    PyTorch
    Hugging Face Transformers
    PEFT
    Pandas
    json

## Installation

    Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```

    Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Getting Started

First, you'll need to log in to your Hugging Face account. The script will prompt you for your credentials.

```python
from huggingface_hub import login
login()
```
## Usage
Training the Model

To train the model, simply run the main script.

```bash
python main.py
```

Here's a brief overview of what the script does:

    Tokenization: Prepares the text data by converting it into tokens.
    Data Preparation: Loads and concatenates multiple datasets into a unified dataset.
    Model Configuration: Sets up model parameters and configurations.
    Training: Trains the model using the Trainer class.
    Push to Hub: Saves the trained model to Hugging Face's Model Hub.
